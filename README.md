[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kMeillet/ying-yang-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kMeillet/ying-yang-react)

We will produce a boilerplate with 3 consideration :

- Functional, modulable, modern.
- Latest package, regular update.
- If you need more, plug it.

# Content

- WebPack 2 with custom abstraction : 3-shaking, multiple loaders/plugins, mixins/hooks system.
- Babel stage-2 (for productive code).
- HMR with React Hot Loader (refresh your component)
- Perfect CSS support : Autoprefixer + CSS mqPacker + CSS Comb.
- EsLint (with AirBnB configuration + some presets to enforce good practice).
- Ramda (functional programming).
- Radium (inline React Style).
- Axios (http Request).
- React with : react-dom, react-router, react-redux, react-functional.
- Redux with : redux-form, redux-thunk.
- Support for Redux DevTools : https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension

# FAQ

### Why i need this ?

Boilerplate are ***opiniated*** and they have ton of possibility.

Boilerplate are used to simplify build-process and focus on project instead of architecture.

If you disallow regular object-oriented programming with class and want to use more functional and pure functions, you're in right place.

Otherwise, you may probably need to use regular React boilerplate or make your one.

You ***never*** need boilerplate to use React, an HTML file with script tag can do it alone.

### I can't use class and this, what the hell ?

The project follow hard rules to enforce good practice for more functional project :

- 2x indent space.
- Comma-dangle in function arguments and Array / Object literal (if they're split into multiple line).
- Don't use of : arguments, class, delete, events, getter, setter, let, var, loops, statement.
- Avoid mutations.
- No var/let, only const.
- Don't use this.
- Don't use null or undefined.
- Don't use ES6 Proxy. 
- Don't use rest parameters.
- Don't write unused expression.
- Don't use valueOf.
- You can't use "console" object, use external logger.
- Default ES6 import without name permitted for merging component.
- Write component as function, forget React.createClass or React.Component.
- Stateless function please.
- No React string refs.
- Function with new cap without constructor are authorized (like Ramda F()).
- For the rest, we follow AirBnB JavaScript standard + React plugin rules.

Why we need that ?

- Bloated components and poor data structures are easily spotted.
- Laziness is dead, youâ€™re forced to think and put state management where it belongs : in higher level container components.
- You may rarely need binding function (in JSX), we try to use pure function.
- Easy to understand and test.
- Performance (in future).

You can change ESLint configuration in ".eslintrc" file.

### How i can add PropTypes or lifecycle hook ?

With "react-functional", function support lifecycle hook.

Add life cycle methods to stateless functional components, without the class noise.

```js
import { React } from 'react';
import functional from 'react-functional';

const ComponentA = props => (
  <div>{ props.name }</div>
);

ComponentA.shouldComponentUpdate = (props, nextProps) => props.name !== nextProps.name;

export default functional(ComponentA);
```

You may notice we mutate Component A : we authorize mutation to add React lifecycle hook and propTypes/defaultProps.

We can use more pure solution (you can use one of them) :

```js
import { React } from 'react';
import functional from 'react-functional';

const ComponentA = props => (
  <div>{ props.name }</div>
);

const hook = {
  shouldComponentUpdate: (props, nextProps) => props.name !== nextProps.name,
};

export default functional(ComponentA, hook);
```

### New router ?

React Router v4 doc : https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v4/README.md

### Can i use ES7 decorators ?

No, spec. can change and we try to use pure function to prevent context binding.

Decorators are really awesome but we don't need it.

### Can i move to Babel stage-0 ?

Stage-0 can be useful for mass export or if you want latest ECMAScript power.

If you want to change stage, remove the old stage in "package.json" and install new stage.

Then, edit ".babelrc" file.

### Why Ramda ? We have Underscore or Lodash !

Ramda has a more focused goal.

Ramda implement Fantasy Land algebraic data-structure (https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land).

Ramda is designed specifically for a functional programming style, one that makes it easy to create functional pipelines, one that never mutates user data.

Ramda can work with React very well.

### Can i use Immutable.js ?

Yes, with immutable PropTypes, that will be good : https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-immutable-proptypes

### How i can add vendor in my project ?

You can add/remove vendor file in "client/vendor.js".

### How i can change WebPack configuration ?

We use custom abstraction to leverage friction with WebPack.

In "__env__" directory, you can find 2 configuration environment : production or development.

You can make your own environment and use it with WebPack.
 
Builder function return WebPack 2 configuration and use 4 params :

- Base provider (a default WebPack configuration).
- Mixins list.
- Loader list.
- Plugins list.

### Can i make global conf for all environment ?

No, every environment has own configuration with mixins, plugins, loaders and base configuration provider.

### How i can use a new loader ?

List of available loaders :

- Assets (images, fonts, videos, sounds)
- Babel
- CSS
- ESLint
- JSON

You can add any loader : install it via npm and write a new loader file in "__env__/providers/loaders" directory with boilerplate :

```js
'use strict';

const ext = [];

const wrapper = {};

const pre = {};

const loader = {};

const post = {};

module.exports = {
  ext,
  wrapper,
  pre,
  loader,
  post,
};
````

As you can see, loaders are plain object with 4 props :
 
- ext : an array of extensions (like .js, .jsx) to target.
- wrapper : wrap loader with custom configuration if needed.
- pre, loader, post : preLoaders, loaders, postLoaders, like in WebPack.

### How i can use a new plugin ?

List of available plugins :

- Assets (create assets.json file for cache)
- Browser (start browser after compiling)
- Chunk (split code into multiple chunk)
- Dashboard (start WebPack dashboard)
- Define (define macro-variable who can be replaced at compilation time)
- DevTool (enabled dev tool and debug mode)
- ExtractCSS (extract CSS into file)
- HMR (add HMR on Dev Server)
- HTML (make and manage HTML file)
- InlineCSS (inline style in page)
- Minify (minify JavaScript)
- NoError (disabled error)
- ProgressBar (progress bar when compiling)
- Provide (link npm module to global scope)

You can add any plugin : install it via npm and write a new plugin file in "__env__/providers/plugins" directory with boilerplate :

```js
'use strict';

const wrapper = () => provider => {
  // Do something on provider ...
  
  return () => ({}); // WebPack plugin or nothing
}

module.exports = wrapper;
```

Plugins are curry function, who need arguments and return a new function who take provider and :

- Return a new function like a WebPack plugin or internal plugin.
- Can mutate provider to change anything before compilation.

### How i can use a new mixin ?

List of available mixins :

- Input (set input)
- Output (set output)

You can add any mixin : write a new mixin file in "__env__/providers/mixins" directory with boilerplate :

```js
'use strict';

const wrapper = () => ({
  /**
   * WebPack object
   */
});

module.exports = wrapper;
```

Mixins are function, who need arguments and return WebPack configuration object.

Every mixins are apply on default configuration to build your personal configuration.
