# ying-yang-react

React Ying Yang consist on a React boilerplate who can pretend to consume any API and make component testable and re-usable.

We will produce a boilerplate with 3 way :

- Simple and elegant.
- Use latest package.
- If you need more, do it.

Warning : if you need isomorphic code (client-side / server-side), move to iso-ying-yang-react package.
