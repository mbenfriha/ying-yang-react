[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kMeillet/ying-yang-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kMeillet/ying-yang-react)

React Ying Yang consist on a React boilerplate who can pretend to consume any API and make component testable and re-usable.

We will produce a boilerplate with 3 way to follow :

- Simple and elegant.
- Use latest package.
- If you need more, do it.

# Content

- WebPack 2 with dev/prod configuration, 3-shaking, multiple loaders/plugins (build system).
- Babel stage-2 (for productive code).
- HMR with React Hot Loader (refresh your component)
- Perfect CSS support : Autoprefixer + CSS mqPacker + CSS Comb.
- EsLint (with AirBnB configuration + some presets to enforce good practice).
- Radium (Inline React Style).
- Axios (Http Request).
- Jest & Enzyme (Testing) [IN PROGRESS]
- Selenium Web Driver (E2E) [IN PROGRESS]
- Ramda (FP).
- React with : react-dom, react-router, react-redux, react-functional.
- Redux with : redux-form, redux-thunk.
- Support for Redux DevTools : https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension

# FAQ

### Why i need this ?

Boilerplate are opiniated and they have ton of possibility.

You need Ying Yang React if you want to make fast project with simple configuration.

If you disallow regular object-oriented programming with class and want to use more functional and pure functions, you're in right place.

Otherwise, you may probably need to use regular React boilerplate or make your one.

### I can't use class and this, what the hell ?

The project follow hard rules to enforce good practice for more functional project :

- 2x indent space.
- Comma-dangle in function arguments and Array / Object literal (if they're split into multiple line).
- Don't use of : arguments, class, delete, events, getter, setter, let, var, loops, statement.
- Avoid mutations.
- No var/let, only const.
- Don't use this.
- Don't use null or undefined.
- Don't use ES6 Proxy. 
- Don't use rest parameters.
- Don't write unused expression.
- Don't use valueOf.
- You can use "console" object (but don't forget to disable this rule before production).
- Default ES6 import without name permitted for merging component.
- Write component as function, forget React.createClass or React.Component.
- Stateless function please.
- No React string refs.
- Function with new cap without constructor are authorized (like Ramda F()).
- For the rest, we follow AirBnB JavaScript standard + React plugin rules, classic.

Why we need that ?

- Bloated components and poor data structures are easily spotted.
- Laziness is dead, youâ€™re forced to think and put state management where it belongs : in higher level container components.
- You may rarely need binding function (in JSX), we try to use pure function.
- Easy to understand and test.
- Performance (in future).

You can change ESLint configuration in ".eslintrc" file.

### How i can add PropTypes or lifecycle hook ?

With "react-functional", function support lifecycle hook.

Add life cycle methods to stateless functional components, without the class noise.

```js
import { React } from 'react'
import functional from 'react-functional'

const ComponentA = props => (
  <div>{ props.name }</div>
);

ComponentA.shouldComponentUpdate = (props, nextProps) =>
    props.name !== nextProps.name

export default functional(ComponentA);
```

You may notice we mutate Component A : we authorize mutation to add React lifecycle hook and propTypes/defaultProps.

We can use more pure solution :

```js
import { React } from 'react'
import functional from 'react-functional'

const ComponentA = props => (
  <div>{ props.name }</div>
);

const hook = {
  shouldComponentUpdate: (props, nextProps) =>
       props.name !== nextProps.name
};

export default functional(ComponentA, hook);
```

### New router ?

React Router v4 doc : https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v4/README.md

### Can i use ES7 decorators ?

No, spec. can change and we try to use pure function to prevent context binding.

If you need it, use it.

### Can i move to Babel stage-0 ?

Stage-0 can be useful for mass export or if you want latest ECMAScript power.

If you want to change stage, remove the old stage in "package.json" and install new stage.

Then, edit ".babelrc" file.

### Why Ramda ? We have Underscore or Lodash !

Ramda has a more focused goal.

Ramda use pattern like iterable, transducer, curry.

Ramda can implement Fantasy Land algebraic data-structure if needed (https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land).

Ramda is designed specifically for a functional programming style, one that makes it easy to create functional pipelines, one that never mutates user data.

Ramda can work with React very well.

### Can i use Immutable.js ?

Yes, with immutable PropTypes, that will be good : https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-immutable-proptypes

### How i can add vendor in my project ?

You can add/remove vendor file in "client/vendor.js".
